#### Handling Responsive Design & Mobile First

Using a pair of media queries would allow segments of the code to be altered when at specific break points in the code. For example I used min-wdith 500px and min-width 100px. Designed for Tablet and Desktop views.

@media screen and (min-width: 500px)

@media screen and (min-width: 1000px)

Furthermore using the meta tag, this would allow the browser to recognize the size and render.
 
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">


#### Learning & Understanding Markdown 

Markdown is totally new to me, this is the first time using it. Although it was tricky at first it allowed me to learn new skills. I also made a imgur account to then directly upload images to imgur. From there i was able to embed the link provided for the markdown file.

#### API & JSON - Wikipedia
The API I used was the google maps api, I was able to change the longitude and get it to focus on the area my band were based in which was birmingham.


#### New Learnings

I learnt many new skills: the ability to create transitions and animations using -webkit and -moz transform. Furthermore the javascript code for implementing a toggle feature using an "addEventListener" to control the functionality was new to me. 

Also the looping function created for transitioning the slide show for my home page, similar to the way I have previously used for loops in #C.
